                    I want to be that candidate before, with your help, becoming Labour’s next member of parliament for Lewisham East. A lifelong
                    Lewisham resident and long committed to values of social justice and equality, I joined the Labour party
                    after being inspired by the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. In the two years since I am grateful to have
                    been part of a movement which has begun to remake politics for the many.

        <p>
            I’m a local councillor, born and bred in Lewisham and will stand up for our community. Lewisham is where I live, where I
            grew up and where I sit as a Labour councillor. I too am affected by the often shambolic service offered by Southern
            Rail and unaffordable local housing and have campaigned to ensure Lewisham Hospital services are protected, properly
            funded and out of private hands. If selectd for a parliamentary seat, my experience of living and growing up
            in Lewisham will make me best placed to stand up for our community.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will amplify the voices of marginalised communities in Lewisham. While Lewisham is one of the most diverse communities
            in the UK our parliament is not, and as a young Pakistani woman who grew up in Lewisham and understand the local
            area, I am best placed to listen to, platform and amplify the voices of marginalised communities in Lewisham.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m a seasoned campaigner at the local and national level, who has skills and experience to advocate for you in parliament.
            From my work in climate change and energy campaigning I understand the challenges we face in tackling a system
            rigged for the few. Most importantly, I know tackling corporate power and inequality starts at the local level.
            I have nationally coordinated Keep Our NHS Public campaigns and believe our NHS must stay public. I will fight
            to ensure Lewisham Hospital services stay protected, properly funded and public. I will fight hard against creeping
            privatisation of our NHS, such as the proposed STP for South East London.
